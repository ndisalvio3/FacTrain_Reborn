# Factrain Reborn

The factory is all there, you only have to build the Transportation!

Like OpenTTD Transport Tycoon Game

The focus of the game is just making trains. Its a Transport Tycoon Scenario type map and it would really be nice if we could get some scripts to improve it. If anyone wanna help. We could even have something with money, cost per rail, train, profits ...

This map already has factories all scattered with a capacity of up to 1,000 sciences per minute, and it is up to you to build hundreds of trains to transport the materials between the factories.

In this version of the map:
-Infinite basic raw material
-Rails and work material available infinitely
-Infinite electric energy for the factories
-Science Challenge (Target 1000 per minute) (You have to research speed and stack size to get this number with the factories) (The game is about balance the items between factories, use the distribution centers!)

I went ahead and updated it to the latest version some parts may be broken feel free to modify and reupload to your hearts content original mod: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Factrain
